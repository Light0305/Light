## What can it help you do?

Light Skills is a public, domain-agnostic skill pack for turning a research or innovation project from a vague idea into auditable deliverables.

| Your situation | What Light Skills helps with |
|---|---|
| I only have a topic | Ask clarifying questions, define constraints, and break the project into stages |
| I have an idea but do not know whether it is new | Search related work, split target/background, find collisions and reviewer attacks |
| I need experiments or data analysis | Design data flow, experiment matrix, scripts, tests, result analysis, and robustness checks |
| I need an English paper | Structure the story, figures, citations, LaTeX typesetting, and pre-submission checks |
| I need scientific figures | Generate Python/R figures programmatically with size, typography, and honesty checks |
| I need a demo or competition interface | Design frontend demos, system structure, interactions, and presentation material |
| I need patent or software copyright material | Draft disclosure materials, technical schemes, embodiments, and document lists |
| I need to continue across chats | Keep a project ledger of goals, decisions, artifacts, unverified claims, and next steps |

## Why it fits research projects

- **Read before writing**: inspect files, data, logs, and paper sources before making claims.
- **Mark unknowns honestly**: facts, DOI, links, venue rules, and software versions are checked instead of guessed.
- **Generate reproducible figures**: paper, data, and experiment figures are produced with Python/R code.
- **Ask at decision points**: topic choice, novelty, evidence strength, venue target, and further investment need user confirmation.
- **No private knowledge base required**: the public package does not require MCP or a local database; current facts are checked at task time.

## Install

Enter the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Light0305/Light-skills.git
cd Light-skills
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
```

### Codex

```powershell
# Project-level: $REPO\.agents\skills
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
python scripts\bootstrap_agent_skills.py --targets agents --mode auto --force

# Global: $HOME\.agents\skills
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.agents\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force .\skills\* "$HOME\.agents\skills\"
```

### Claude Code

```powershell
# Project-level: $REPO\.claude\skills\<skill>\SKILL.md
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
python scripts\bootstrap_agent_skills.py --targets claude --mode auto --force

# Global: $HOME\.claude\skills
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.claude\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force .\skills\* "$HOME\.claude\skills\"
```

### OpenCode

```powershell
# Project-level: $REPO\.opencode\skills\<skill>\SKILL.md
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
python scripts\bootstrap_agent_skills.py --targets opencode --mode auto --force

# Global: $HOME\.config\opencode\skills
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.config\opencode\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force .\skills\* "$HOME\.config\opencode\skills\"
```

Check the installation:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
python scripts\bootstrap_agent_skills.py --check-only
```

## Environment

### Base

- Git
- Python 3.10+
- On Windows, set `$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"` before running Python scripts.

### LaTeX

```powershell
winget install --id MiKTeX.MiKTeX --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
latexmk -v
pdflatex --version
xelatex --version
biber --version
```

Use this for paper typesetting, PDF compilation, and template checks. `light-typesetting` supports `latexmk`, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX, BibTeX, and Biber. If a tool is missing, it reports `UNAVAILABLE` instead of pretending that a PDF was delivered.

### R

```powershell
winget install --id RProject.R --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
Rscript -e "install.packages(c('ggplot2','scales'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')"
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
python skills\light-figure\scripts\r_ggplot.py --detect
```

Use this for ggplot2 scientific figures. If R is missing, the figure skill should ask whether to continue with a Python fallback or install/configure R.

## Research workflow

Light Skills is not designed to let an agent blindly run the whole project end to end. It breaks research into auditable stages with explicit checkpoints, rollback paths, and user decisions.
